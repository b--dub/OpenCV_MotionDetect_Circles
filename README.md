OpenCV_MotionDetect_Circles
===========================

Motion Detection and Video Interaction with OpenCV

This program uses C++ (in VS2010) and the OpenCV library to track motion detected in live web-cam video and allows the user to interact with a set of moving and bouncing circles.  For the demo I am using a really low definition Wii camera that you can pick up with a game for less than ten bucks, and a 10 year old Compaq desktop running Windows XP.  Needless to say, if you wanted to get it to do more there should be plenty of room performance wise to do so.  

As I said the repository is formated to VC++2010 but you will need to have the OpenCV library on your machine to compile the code (whether you are using the VS folders or not) and then have it linked in to your build.  I don't think I can stress enough that this preliminary requirement is in itself not the simplest thing to accomplish.  

I have another version of this program that I am still working on that incorporates the SDL library for sprite animation (to replace the simple circles) and layered sounds.  I will try to remember to post it as well once I get a chance to get back to it.
